Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible. PCA identifies the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original features that capture the most variance. It is widely used for data visualization, noise reduction, and feature extraction, making it easier to analyze and interpret complex datasets.

This dataset includes various socioeconomic indicators for different countries, such as child_mort (child mortality), exports, health, imports, income, inflation, life_expec (life expectancy), total_fer (total fertility rate), and gdp (gross domestic product). By applying PCA, we aim to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, enabling us to identify key factors that explain variations in socioeconomic performance across countries. The findings can help in understanding the relationships between different indicators and provide insights into global health and economic trends.
